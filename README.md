micro capitalism protocol

Introduction

Micro Capitalism Protocol is an at-will strategy for a distributed network of small businesses to interoperate and retain value and remain competitive in their local economies.  It is not a business model, but an interface that can be implemented in a variety of ways

The protocol is made up of  2 concepts and 3 rules.

The Store:
A store is a concept that represents the aggregation of goods, resources, or money.
It could be a warehouse, or a pool of funds.

The Pod:
A pod is defined as two or more entities that use a store.  These entities could be small businesses, individuals, or other pods. These entities buy and sell from the store, and then sell to consumers.


The Rules:

Only the entities in the pod can buy or sell directly from that pod’s store.
Entities sell to the store cheaper than they would outside the store.
Pods should only be made up of entities of the same type, whether it is a pod of individuals, businesses, or pods.  A pod of pods should not be able to access one of it’s pod’s stores directly.


When a pod wants to buy or sell from other pods, they can use a store, which makes those pods another pod.  As the network of pods grow, the access to the diversity of goods, service and resources increases.
